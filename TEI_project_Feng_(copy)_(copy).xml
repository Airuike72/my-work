            <p>‘Sir, yes sir. Initiating survey of the third planet. Projecting beam sent. This planet has an average atmospheric density. Most of its surface is covered by ocean.’</p><p>THE LIFE SURVEY BEAM fell on <placeName key="South Asia" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q771405"><note type="annotation">The story of 18 children and time-traveler happends here, it is a coincidence but also the fate of the main characters</note>a slightly southerly portion of the Asian continent</placeName>. The tip of the beam formed a circle on the ground with a diameter of roughly five thousand metres. If it was daylight, one could detect the beam with the naked eye as all non-living things within the beam’s range became transparent when it hit them. It now shone on a small mountainous region in north-western China, and the loess slopes would have looked to an observer like crystal. The sun would have refracted in and out of these mountains, creating a truly magnificent scene. The observer would have seen the ground below him transformed into a bottomless abyss. All things determined to be living remained unchanged. People, trees, and grass would have stood out with utter clarity in this crystalline world. But this effect would only have lasted for half a second. During this time the scanning beam would have already completed its initial scan and everything would have returned to normal. The observer would have thought it a momentary hallucination. But right now it was night and naturally it was difficult to notice anything.</p><p>The village school happened to be right at the centre of the circle made by the survey beam.</p><p>‘RANDOM LOCATION SURVEY number 1. The result is ... green! The result is green! <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs> reporting. Target 500921473. The third planet contains life!’</p><p>The survey beam began to classify the many kinds of life that fell within its range, ranking the species according to the complexity of their structure and their estimated stages of intelligence, and putting them in order in its digital database. The group of creatures under a square shelter were ranked at the top. The beam speedily retracted, focusing on that shelter.</p><p>The <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>’s intelligence field received <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>’s image and enlarged it to cover the entire space background. That image of the village schoolhouse in an instant covered the entire universe. The image processing system had already removed the shelter, but the images of the life forms were still unclear. These life forms’ appearance was not eye-catching in the slightest and even seemed to blend in with the silicas and yellow dirt that surrounded them. The main computer could not but eliminate from the image everything lifeless, including <persName cert="high" type="real">the larger dead form<note type="annotation">The dead body of Li Baoer, the former mentioned that he was running out of time</note></persName> that was surrounded by the life forms, making them look as though they were suspended alone in the vast emptiness. Even this way they seemed rather ordinary, devoid of colour, looking like yellow plants. One look and you knew these creatures weren’t capable of performing miracles.</p><p><rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs> projected a thin four-dimensional beam. The moon-sized ship had anchored just outside Jupiter’s orbit, temporarily providing the solar system with an additional planet. The four-dimensional beam moved through three- dimensional space toward Earth at almost infinite speed. It plunged straight through the roof of the school and began conducting an elementary particle scan on</p><p><persName xml:id="HumanChildren" cert="high" type="fictional">the eighteen children</persName>. The torrent of information returned to space at a speed scarcely conceivable to humans. In an instant the <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName>’s digital replicas had been assembled in <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>’s main computer’s database, a database more vast than the universe itself.<persName ref="#HumanChildren">The eighteen children</persName> were suspended in a boundless space of a colour impossible to describe, not really a colour at all since the void does not have a colour but is more transparent than transparent. The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> couldn’t help but grab onto each other. They looked normal but their hands passed through each other’s bodies without the slightest obstruction. The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> felt an indescribable terror. The main computer observed this, and thinking that these life forms needed familiar objects, it created in its own internal universe a blue that mimicked that of the planet’s sky. The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> immediately looked up at the blue sky, with no sun and no clouds and no dust, just blue, so pure and profound. There was no ground under their feet but a sky same as the one over their heads. They seemed to be in a universe of endless blue, and they were the only substance in it. The computer felt that these digital life forms were still in panic and in a millionth of a second, understood: most of the living things in the Milky Way galaxy were not afraid of being suspended in space, but these life forms were not the same. They were land creatures. It therefore provided them with ground and a feeling of gravity. The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> were surprised to see the ground suddenly appear beneath their feet. It was pure white and its surface was criss-crossed with an orderly black and white grid. They seemed to be standing on a gridded writing practice book that extended to infinity. Some of them bent down to touch it. It was the smoothest thing any of them had ever seen. They took long strides but did not move, as the surface was absolutely smooth, the coefficient of friction was zero. They wondered why they did not fall down. One of the <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> took off a shoe and slid it across the ground. This shoe slid forward at a uniform speed. The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> stared as it moved off into the distance at an unchanging speed.</p><p>They had seen Newton’s first law.</p><p>A sound, gentle and lovely, resounded in the digital universe.</p><p>‘Begin the 3C Civilization Test. 3C Civilization Test question number 1: Please describe the evolutionary principle of life on your planet. Is it natural selection or gene mutation?’</p><p>The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> remained in stupefied silence.</p><p>‘3C Civilization Test question number 2: Please briefly state the source of the stars’ energy.’</p><p>The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> still remained in stupefied silence.</p><p>...</p><p>‘3C Civilization Test question number 10: Please explain the molecular structure of the liquid which fills your oceans.’</p><p>The stupefied silence continued.</p><p>The shoe, now only a tiny dot on the horizon, disappeared.</p><p>‘Let’s stop here.’ the <persName ref="#AlienFleetCommander"> Commander</persName> said to the <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName> 1,000 light years away. ‘We cannot delay any longer, or we won’t be able to complete the first stage of the mission on time.’</p><p>The <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>’s intelligence field rippled slightly to signal agreement. ‘Launch the singularity bomb!’</p>
	<eventName>singularity bomb launched</eventName>
			<p>The beam carrying this information travelled through four-dimensional space and arrived in an instant at <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>, anchored in the middle of the solar system. A faintly glowing foggy ball slid out of the front of the battleship and down the long guide rail, following an invisible tractor beam as it swiftly gathered speed and hurtled toward the sun.</p><p>The <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>, the Senator, and the Fleet <persName ref="#AlienFleetCommander"> Commander</persName> turned their attention to other areas of the quarantine zone, where they found a few more planetary systems that contained life. But the highest form of life they found was a brainless worm that lived in mud. The exploding stars looked like blossoming fireworks, reminding them of the epic Campaign of the Second Spiral Arm.</p><p>After a long time, a small portion of the <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>’s intelligence field unconsciously wandered to the solar system. He heard the voice of <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>’s captain:</p><p>‘Prepare to exit the force field of the explosion. Ready for space-time jump. Thirty second countdown.’</p><p>‘Wait, how long will it take for the singularity bomb to hit the target?’ the <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName> asked. His question attracted the attention of the Senator and the Fleet <persName ref="#AlienFleetCommander"> Commander</persName>.</p><p>‘It is crossing the orbit of the innermost planet to the star, so it will take another ten minutes.’</p><p>‘Spend the next five minutes doing a few more tests.’</p><p>The voice of <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>’s <persName xml:id="ALienDutyOfficer" key="Duty officer" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duty_officer">duty-officer</persName> rang out. ‘ 3C Civilization Test question number 11: On a three-dimensional plane, what is the relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle?’</p><p>Silence.</p><p>‘3C Civilization Test question number 12: What number planet is your planet within your solar system?’</p><p>Silence.</p><p>‘Sir, this is pointless,’ the <persName ref="#AlienFleetCommander"> Commander</persName> said.</p><p>‘3C Civilization Test question number 13: Describe the motion of a body when unaffected by external force.’</p><p>The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName>’s clear voices suddenly sounded out through the wide blue space of the digital universe: ‘A body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, when it is not compelled to change that state by external force.’</p><p>‘Question number 13 passed! 3C Civilization Test question number 14 ...’</p>

The two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.’</p><p>‘Question number 14 passed! 3C Civilization Test question number 15: Explain the relation between the mass of a body, its acceleration, and the force exerted on it.’</p><p>The <persName ref="#HumanChildren">children</persName> chanted: ‘The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the force causing it, and inversely proportional to the mass.’</p><p>‘Question number 15 on the 3C Civilization Test passed.

			<p>‘Redirect the singularity bomb away from the target<note type="annotation">The aliens decided to redirect the sigularity bomb because they realized that the civilization on Earth fit their requirement of "pure flame of civilization" that can save their civilization from catastrophy. The children can never answer these questions correctly without their teacher - Li Baoer. As a time-traveler who does not have mush time in this world, Li Baor is so eager to teach his students about physics and requires them to memorize the content because he knows his time is running out. Li Baor is terminally ill, and his life is nearing its end. As a teacher who deeply understands the importance of knowledge, he wants to impart as much knowledge as possible to his students within the limited time he has left, especially the fundamental principles of science—physics.

He believes that physics is key to understanding the world, and for the children, this knowledge could be the foundation for escaping poverty and achieving better life opportunities in the future. The emphasis on memorization is likely because, in that era and region, books and educational resources were scarce, and memorization was an effective way to ensure knowledge was preserved and passed down.
Moreover, the deeper meaning of the story also lies in the fact that Li Baor’s dedication to education is not just for the sake of his students' futures, but also because he believes in the importance of knowledge for individuals and for civilization as a whole. He hopes his students can become "vessels" that carry the seeds of knowledge, so that even in his absence, this knowledge can continue to have an impact on the future.</note>!’ The <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>’s intelligence field flashed urgently, forcefully sending his order through hyperspace to <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>.</p><p>Inside the solar system, the repulsor beam propelling the singularity bomb<note>A singularity bomb refer to a highly advanced theoretical weapon that destroys its target by creating a gravitational singularity, that is, a black hole. Such a weapon in a sci-fi setting might be used to annihilate an enemy or as a last resort to prevent some kind of catastrophe. In this story, the aliens lauched the singularity bomb to destroy planets with no civilization or with civilizations that fell into endless warfare that is impossible to find pure flame of civilization which is vital for the survival of their civilization.</note> curved. It bent like a bow hundreds of millions of kilometres long, straining to divert the bomb from its trajectory toward the sun. The force field generator on <rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs> was operating at maximum capacity, and its immense heat dispersion plates turned from dull red to white-hot. The force field it beamed out was starting to make the trajectory of the singularity bomb curve away, but it had already crossed Mercury’s orbit and was now too close to the sun. No one knew whether the redirection would succeed. Through live hyperspace projection, the whole Milky Way was gazing at the trajectory of that foggy ball, and watching it suddenly get brighter. This was an alarming sign: it meant the bomb was already encountering the greater density of particles surrounding the sun. The captain’s hand was on the red button for space-time jump, so as to escape the area the instant before the singularity bomb hit. But the bomb grazed the sun like a bullet, with only a few dozen kilometres to spare. The singularity bomb grew bright as the black hole sucked in the matter from the sun’s corona, becoming a flaming blue-white sphere that became visible at the edge of the sun. For an instant, they looked like a double star system, a sight humans would never be able to explain. As the blue-white sphere whizzed by, the sun’s own ocean of fire dimmed by comparison. Like a boat speeding through calm water, the black hole’s gravitational force made a V-shaped wave on the surface of the sun that spread across a whole hemisphere before it disappeared. The singularity bomb ruptured a solar prominence, making this beautiful million-kilometres-long veil that rose from the sun shatter into a beautiful dancing vortex of plasma swirls under the impact of such high velocity ... Soon after the bomb had skimmed past the sun, it dimmed and vanished into the vast night of the universe.</p><p>‘We nearly destroyed a carbon-based civilization,’ the Senator breathed.</p><p>‘Crazy, isn’t it, a level 3C civilization in such an isolated place!’ exclaimed the <persName ref="#AlienFleetCommander"> Commander</persName>.</p><p>‘That’s true, neither the Carbon-based Federation nor the Silicon-based Empire included this area in their plans for civilizational mentoring and development, so if this civilization evolved on its own, that makes it unique,’ said the <persName ref="#AlienAdministrator"> Chief Administrator</persName>.</p><p>‘<rs ref="#AlineSpaceship"> Blue 84210</rs>, stay in that solar system and thoroughly examine the level of civilization across the entire surface of Planet No. 3.

Li Baor's role is not just that of a rural teacher; he is also a bearer of knowledge and civilization. Through his teaching, he hopes to ignite an interest in science within the children, despite the remote and impoverished setting they are in. And luckyly, his knowledge helped the entire human civilization to avoid being neutralized by the mysterious aliens.</note>’s body in the flickering candlelight, sobbing.

<p>‘For instance, what is the level of hereditary biological memory on this planet?’ ‘They don’t inherit memories biologically. All their memories are acquired.’ ‘How do individual beings communicate among themselves, then?’</p><p>‘By a primitive and unusual means. They have a very thin organ inside their bodies which, when it vibrates in the chiefly nitrogen- and oxygen-based atmosphere of the planet, creates sound waves. They encode the information they want to convey in these sound waves, and the recipient absorbs this from the sound waves via another thin-membrane organ.<note type="annotation">It refers to the human communication: we communicate through talking and listening, which is too inefficient and ineffective for 4-dimensional creatures</note>’</p><p>‘How fast is this means of communication?’</p><p>‘One to ten bits per second.’</p><p>‘What?’ Everyone on the spaceship began to laugh.</p><p>‘It really is one to ten bits per second.
